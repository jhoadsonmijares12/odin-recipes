<h2>Picaña grill</h2>
<p> It is a piece of meat, a long muscle, that is located at the end of the leg, on the hip of the bovine and on both sides of the spine, which is why each animal has two picañas. It is a piece of meat that is one of the most popular in Brazilian cuisine and is not usually missing in the classic Argentine and Uruguayan grills. Until recently it was not seen much but in recent years there have been numerous restaurants that have it in their offering and some butcher shops as well, especially in Spain, also because its price is quite affordable.
